# MotionControl

Motion Control is a framework for building motion control applications. Its primary focus is the low level conception of robotics systems. It is primarily coded in C and the block within can be used to build complex systems focusing on a degree of freedom at a time.
The framework features a modular approach and is easy to comprehend. 

Many complicated motion control projects have been implemented using the framework.

Future Work
Parameter based automatic code generation is beign implemented. And should be available within the following months.

More files will be added as the documentation is completed.
